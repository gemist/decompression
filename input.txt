# SAMPLE DIVE TO 60 METERS OF SEAWATER GAUGE (MSWG) FOR 30 MINUTES
# 
# Everything behind character # is comment and it is ignored. Comments 
# can be only between sections GASES, DIVE, DECO
# 
# GASES: firstly you specify the number of gases that are going 
# to be used during the dive. After that are fractions of gases (f) 
# separeted by comma in following order fO2, fHe, fN2 
#

#GASES

# use case: dive to 60m

3                # use 3 gas mixtures
0.18,0.40,0.42   # 1 gas mixture (f02, fHe, fN2) 
0.50,0.00,0.50   # 2 gas mixture (f02, fHe, fN2) 
1.00,0.00,0.00   # 3 gas mixture (f02, fHe, fN2) 
descent          # descent
0 60 10 1        # from 0m to 60m with speed 10m/min - gas mixture 1
const_depth      # be on constant depth
60 30 1          # 60m for 30min with gas mixture 1
deco             # cancel dive and start decompression
1 -10 3 0.85 0.3 # start with gas mixture 1 with speed -10m/min, deco stops every 3m using gradient factors GF (0.85,0.3)
21 3             # change gas mixture at 21m and (be there 3 minutes)
2 -10 3          # continue with gas mixture 2 and ascent with speed -10m/min (deco stops every 3m)
6  3             # change gas at 6 m and (be there 3 minutes)
3 -3 6           # use gas mixture 3 and ascent with -3m/min, deco stops every 6m
0                # depth 0m - finish the dive
